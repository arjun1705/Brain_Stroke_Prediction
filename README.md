# Stroke Prediction Model

## Overview 🚀
The Stroke Prediction Model project is designed to assess stroke risk using advanced machine learning techniques. This end-to-end solution covers data collection, preprocessing, model selection, training, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment. A user-friendly interface delivers real-time predictions and comprehensive reports with actionable recommendations.

## Data Collection 📋
- **Patient Demographics:** Age, gender, etc.
- **Medical History:** Hypertension, heart disease, etc.
- **Lifestyle Factors:** Smoking status, work type, etc.
- **Clinical Measurements:** Average glucose level, BMI, and more.

## Data Preprocessing 🧹
- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Feature Scaling:** Normalize or standardize features for consistent scales.
- **Data Transformation:** Prepare data for modeling by encoding categorical variables.

## Model Selection & Training 🤖
- **Algorithm Choices:**
  - **Random Forest:** High accuracy, robust predictions.
  - **Logistic Regression:** Superior interpretability; identifies key risk factors.
  - **XGBoost & LightGBM:** Boosting algorithms that capture complex patterns.
  - **Support Vector Machine & Decision Trees:** Additional models explored.
- **Training & Evaluation:**
  - Train the model using training data.
  - Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Hyperparameter Tuning ⚙️
- **Optimization:** Tune hyperparameters such as learning rate and regularization strength.
- **SMOTE:** Apply Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique to address class imbalance, enhancing model performance for rare stroke cases.

## Model Deployment & Prediction 🚀
- **Deployment:** Integrate the trained model into a Flask web application.
- **Prediction:** Provide real-time stroke risk predictions based on user input.
- **Reporting:** Generate comprehensive reports with:
  - Warning signs
  - Recommended precautions
  - Emergency preparedness guidelines for healthcare professionals

## User Interface & Reporting 📊
- **Intuitive UI:** Easily enter patient data and receive immediate feedback.
- **Actionable Insights:** Detailed risk assessments with clear recommendations.
